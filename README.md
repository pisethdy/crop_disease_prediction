# **🌱AI-Powered Crop Disease Prediction Using CNN🌾**

Welcome to the **Crop Disease Prediction** project! This interactive web application leverages the power of **AI** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to identify and classify crop diseases. Users can easily upload images of their crops and receive predictions on potential diseases, along with confidence scores. 

Built using **TensorFlow** for model predictions and **Streamlit** for an intuitive and sleek user interface, this project makes plant health monitoring both simple and efficient.

## **✨ Features**
- 📸 **Upload Crop Images**: Supports `JPG`, `JPEG`, and `PNG` formats for easy image uploads.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Disease Prediction**: Accurately predicts the disease affecting your crop (or confirms it's healthy!).
- 📊 **Confidence Scores**: Get the prediction’s confidence level to understand the model’s certainty.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: A seamless, real-time, and interactive web app experience.
